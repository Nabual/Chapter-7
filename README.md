# Chapter-7:  Adding Animation to an App
### What I Learned
I learned how to use Flutterâ€™s animation framework to bring dynamic elements to applications. This included working with Tween for defining value changes over a duration and AnimatedBuilder for efficiently rebuilding widgets during animations. I also explored how to create smooth transitions between screens and add engaging effects, like animated buttons, to enhance interactivity.

### Achievement
I successfully built an app that incorporates animated transitions for screen navigation and interactive button effects, showcasing my ability to apply Flutter's animation tools effectively.
